h2. 1.3.5

* Added `:reader` and `:writer` to allow overriding rendering/parsing of a property fragment and to give the user access to the entire document.

h2. 1.3.4

* Replacing `json` gem with `multi_json` hoping not to cause trouble.

h2. 1.3.3

* Added new options: `:binding`, `:setter` and `:getter`.
* The `:if` option now eventually receives passed in user options.

h2. 1.3.2

* Some minor internal changes. Added `Config#inherit` to encasulate array push behavior.

h2. 1.3.1

* Bringing back `:as`. For some strange reasons "we" lost that commit from @csexton!!!

h2. 1.3.0

* Remove @:exclude@ option.
* Moving all read/write logic to @Binding@. If you did override @#read_fragment@ and friends in your representer/models this won't work anymore.
* Options passed to @to_*/from_*@ are now passed to nested objects.

h2. 1.2.9

* When @:class@ returns @nil@ we no longer try to create a new instance but use the processed fragment itself.
* @:instance@ allows overriding the @ObjectBinding#create_object@ workflow by returning an instance from the lambda. This is particularly helpful when you need to inject additional data into the property object created in #deserialize.
* @:extend@ and @:class@ now also accept procs which allows having polymorphic properties and collections where representer and class can be chosen at runtime.

h2. 1.2.8

* Reverting all the bullshit from 1.2.7 making it even better. @Binding@s now wrap their @Definition@ instance adopting its API. Moved the binding_for_definition mechanics to the respecting @Binding@ subclass.
* Added :readable and :writeable to #property: while @:readable => true@ renders the property into the document @:writeable => true@ allows updating the property's value when consuming a representation. Both default to @true@.

h2. 1.2.7

* Moving @Format.binding_for_definition@ to @Format#{format}_binding_for_definition@, making it an instance method in its own "namespace". This allows mixing in multiple representer engines into a user's representer module.

h2. 1.2.6

* Extracted @HashRepresenter@ which operates on hash structures. This allows you to "parse" form data, e.g. as in Rails' @params@ hash. Internally, this is used by JSON and partly by YAML.

h2. 1.2.5

* Add support for YAML.

h2. 1.2.4

* ObjectBinding no longer tries to extend nil values when rendering and @:render_nil@ is set.
* In XML you can now use @:wrap@ to define an additional container tag around properties and collections.

h2. 1.2.3

* Using virtus for coercion now works in both classes and modules. Thanks to @solnic for a great collaboration. Open-source rocks!

h2. 1.2.2

* Added @XML::AttributeHash@ to store hash key-value pairs in attributes instead of dedicated tags.
* @JSON::Hash@, @XML::Hash@ and @XML::AttributeHash@ now respect @:exclude@ and @:include@ when parsing and rendering.

h2. 1.2.1

* Deprecated @:represent_nil@ favor of @:render_nil@.
* API change: if a property is missing in an incoming document and there is no default set it is completely ignored and *not* set in the represented object.


h2. 1.2.0

* Deprecated @:except@ in favor of @:exclude@.
* A property with @false@ value will now be included in the rendered representation. Same applies to parsing, @false@ values will now be included. That particularly means properties that used to be unset (i.e. @nil@) after parsing might be @false@ now.
* You can include @nil@ values now in your representations since @#property@ respects @:represent_nil => true@.

h2. 1.1.6

* Added @:if@ option to @property@.

h2. 1.1.5

* Definitions are now properly cloned when @Config@ is cloned.

h2. 1.1.4

* representable_attrs is now cloned when a representer module is included in an inheriting representer.

h2. 1.1.3

* Introduced `#compile_fragment` and friends to make it simpler overriding parsing and rendering steps.

h2. 1.1.2

* Allow `Module.hash` to be called without arguments as this seems to be required in Padrino.

h2. 1.1.1

* When a representer module is extended we no longer set the <code>@representable_attrs</code> ivar directly but use a setter. This makes it work with mongoid and fixes https://github.com/apotonick/roar/issues/10.

h2. 1.1.0

* Added `JSON::Collection` to have plain list representations. And `JSON::Hash` for hashes.
* Added the `hash` class method to XML and JSON to represent hashes.
* Defining `:extend` only on a property now works for rendering. If you try parsing without a `:class` there'll be an exception, though.

h2. 1.0.1

* Allow passing a list of modules to :extend, like @:extend => [Ingredient, IngredientRepresenter]@.

h2. 1.0.0

* 1.0.0 release! Party time!

h2. 0.13.1

* Removed property :@name from @XML@ in favor of @:attribute => true@.

h2. 0.13.0

* We no longer create accessors in @Representable.property@ - you have to do this yourself using @attr_accessors@.

h2. 0.12.0

* @:as@ is now @:class@.

h2. 0.11.0

* Representer modules can now be injected into objects using @#extend@.
* The @:extend@ option allows setting a representer module for a typed property. This will extend the contained object at runtime roughly following the DCI pattern.
* Renamed @#representable_property@ and @#representable_collection@ to @#property@ and @#collection@ as we don't have to fear namespace collisions in modules.

h2. 0.10.3

* Added @representable_property :default => ...@ option which is considered for both serialization and deserialization. The default is applied when the value is @nil@. Note that an empty string ain't @nil@.
* @representable_attrs@ are now pushed to instance level as soon as possible.

h2. 0.10.2

* Added @representable_property :accessors => false@ option to suppress adding accessors.
* @Representable.representation_wrap@ is no longer inherited.
* Representers can now be defined in modules. They inherit to including modules.

h2. 0.10.1

* The block in @to_*@ and @from_*@ now yields the symbolized property name. If you need the binding/definition you gotta get it yourself.
* Runs with Ruby 1.8 and 1.9.

h2. 0.10.0

* Wrapping can now be set through @Representable.representation_wrap=@. Possible values are:
  * @false@: No wrapping. In XML context, this is undefined behaviour. Default in JSON.
  * @String@: Wrap with provided string.
  * @true@: compute wrapper from class name.

h2. 0.9.3

* Removed the @:as => [..]@ syntax in favor of @:array => true@.

h2. 0.9.2

* Arguments and block now successfully forwarded in @#from_*@.

h2. 0.9.1

* Extracted common serialization into @Representable#create_representation_with@ and deserialization into @#update_properties_from@.
* Both serialization and deserialization now accept a block to make them skip elements while iterating the property definitions.

h2. 0.9.0

h3. Changes
  * Removed the :tag option in favor of :from. The Definition#from method is now authorative for all name mappings.
  * Removed the active_support and i18n dependency.
