# Representable

Representable maps ruby objects to documents and back.

In other words: Take an object and extend it with a representer module. This will allow you to render a JSON, XML or YAML document from that object. But that's only half of it! You can also use representers to parse a document and create an object.

Representable is helpful for all kind of rendering and parsing workflows. However, it is mostly useful in API code. Are you planning to write a real REST API with representable? Then check out the [roar](http://github.com/apotonick/roar) gem first, save work and time and make the world a better place instead.


## Installation

The representable gem is almost dependency-free. Almost.

    gem 'representable'


## Example

What if we're writing an API for music - songs, albums, bands.

    class Song < OpenStruct
    end

    song = Song.new(title: "Fallout", track: 1)


## Defining Representations

Representations are defined using representer modules.

    require 'representable/json'

    module SongRepresenter
      include Representable::JSON

      property :title
      property :track
    end

In the representer the #property method allows declaring represented attributes of the object. All the representer requires for rendering are readers on the represented object, e.g. `#title` and `#track`. When parsing, it will call setters - in our example, that'd be `#title=` and `#track=`.


## Rendering

Mixing in the representer into the object adds a rendering method.

    song.extend(SongRepresenter).to_json
    #=> {"title":"Fallout","track":1}


## Parsing

It also adds support for parsing.

    song = Song.new.extend(SongRepresenter).from_json(%{ {"title":"Roxanne"} })
    #=> #<Song title="Roxanne", track=nil>

## Aliasing

If your property name doesn't match the name in the document, use the `:as` option.

    module SongRepresenter
      include Representable::JSON

      property :title, as: :name
      property :track
    end

    song.to_json #=> {"name":"Fallout","track":1}


## Wrapping

Let the representer know if you want wrapping.

    module SongRepresenter
      include Representable::JSON

      self.representation_wrap= :hit

      property :title
      property :track
    end

This will add a container for rendering and consuming.

    song.extend(SongRepresenter).to_json
    #=> {"hit":{"title":"Fallout","track":1}}

Setting `self.representation_wrap = true` will advice representable to figure out the wrap itself by inspecting the represented object class.


## Collections

Let's add a list of composers to the song representation.

    module SongRepresenter
      include Representable::JSON

      property :title
      property :track
      collection :composers
    end

Surprisingly, `#collection` lets us define lists of objects to represent.

    Song.new(title: "Fallout", composers: ["Steward Copeland", "Sting"]).
      extend(SongRepresenter).to_json

    #=> {"title":"Fallout","composers":["Steward Copeland","Sting"]}


And again, this works both ways - in addition to the title it extracts the composers from the document, too.


## Nesting

Representers can also manage compositions. Why not use an album that contains a list of songs?

    class Album < OpenStruct
    end

    album = Album.new(name: "The Police", songs: [song, Song.new(title: "Synchronicity")])


Here comes the representer that defines the composition.

    module AlbumRepresenter
      include Representable::JSON

      property :name
      collection :songs, extend: SongRepresenter, class: Song
    end

Note that nesting works with both plain `#property` and `#collection`.

When rendering, the `:extend` module is used to extend the attribute(s) with the correct representer module.

    album.extend(AlbumRepresenter).to_json
    #=> {"name":"The Police","songs":[{"title":"Fallout","composers":["Steward Copeland","Sting"]},{"title":"Synchronicity","composers":[]}]}

Parsing a documents needs both `:extend` and the `:class` option as the parser requires knowledge what kind of object to create from the nested composition.

    Album.new.extend(AlbumRepresenter).
      from_json(%{{"name":"Offspring","songs":[{"title":"Genocide"},{"title":"Nitro","composers":["Offspring"]}]}})

    #=> #<Album name="Offspring", songs=[#<Song title="Genocide">, #<Song title="Nitro", composers=["Offspring"]>]>


## XML Support

While representable does a great job with JSON, it also features support for XML, YAML and pure ruby hashes.

    require 'representable/xml'

    module SongRepresenter
      include Representable::XML

      property :title
      property :track
      collection :composers
    end

For XML we just include the `Representable::XML` module.

    Song.new(title: "Fallout", composers: ["Steward Copeland", "Sting"]).
      extend(SongRepresenter).to_xml

    #=> <song>
          <title>Fallout</title>
          <composers>Steward Copeland</composers>
          <composers>Sting</composers>
        </song>

## Passing Options

You're free to pass an options hash into the rendering or parsing.

    song.to_json(:append => "SOLD OUT!")

If you want to append the "SOLD OUT!" to the song's `title` when rendering, use the `:getter` option.

    SongRepresenter
      include Representable::JSON

      property :title, :getter => lambda { |args| title + args[:append] }
    end

Note that the block is executed in the represented model context which allows using accessors and instance variables.


The same works for parsing using the `:setter` method.

    property :title, :setter => lambda { |val, args| self.title= val + args[:append] }

Here, the block retrieves two arguments: the parsed value and your user options.

You can also use the `:getter` option instead of writing a reader method. Even when you're not interested in user options you can still use this technique.

    property :title, :getter => lambda { |*| @name }

This hash will also be available in the `:if` block, documented [here](https://github.com/apotonick/representable/#conditions) and will be passed to nested objects.

## Using Helpers

Sometimes it's useful to override accessors to customize output or parsing.

    module AlbumRepresenter
      include Representable::JSON

      property :name
      collection :songs

      def name
        super.upcase
      end
    end

    Album.new(:name => "The Police").
      extend(AlbumRepresenter).to_json

    #=> {"name":"THE POLICE","songs":[]}

Note how the representer allows calling `super` in order to access the original attribute method of the represented object.

To change the parsing process override the setter.

      def name=(value)
        super(value.downcase)
      end


## Inheritance

To reuse existing representers you can inherit from those modules.

    module CoverSongRepresenter
      include Representable::JSON
      include SongRepresenter

      property :copyright
    end

Inheritance works by `include`ing already defined representers.

    Song.new(:title => "Truth Hits Everybody", :copyright => "The Police").
      extend(CoverSongRepresenter).to_json

    #=> {"title":"Truth Hits Everybody","copyright":"The Police"}


## Polymorphic Extend

Sometimes heterogenous collections of objects from different classes must be represented. Or you don't know which representer to use at compile-time and need to delay the computation until runtime. This is why `:extend` accepts a lambda, too.

Given we not only have songs, but also cover songs.

    class CoverSong < Song
    end

And a non-homogenous collection of songs.

    songs = [ Song.new(title: "Weirdo", track: 5),
              CoverSong.new(title: "Truth Hits Everybody", track: 6, copyright: "The Police")]

    album = Album.new(name: "Incognito", songs: songs)


The `CoverSong` instances are to be represented by their very own `CoverSongRepresenter` defined above. We can't just use a static module in the `:extend` option, so go use a dynamic lambda!

    module AlbumRepresenter
      include Representable::JSON

      property :name
      collection :songs, :extend => lambda { |song| song.is_a?(CoverSong) ? CoverSongRepresenter : SongRepresenter }
    end

Note that the lambda block is evaluated in the represented object context which allows to access helpers or whatever in the block. This works for single properties, too.


## Polymorphic Object Creation

Rendering heterogenous collections usually implies that you also need to parse those. Luckily, `:class` also accepts a lambda.

    module AlbumRepresenter
      include Representable::JSON

      property :name
      collection :songs,
        :extend => ...,
        :class  => lambda { |hsh| hsh.has_key?("copyright") ? CoverSong : Song }
    end

The block for `:class` receives the currently parsed fragment. Here, this might be somthing like `{"title"=>"Weirdo", "track"=>5}`.

If this is not enough, you may override the entire object creation process using `:instance`.

    module AlbumRepresenter
      include Representable::JSON

      property :name
      collection :songs,
        :extend   => ...,
        :instance => lambda { |hsh| hsh.has_key?("copyright") ? CoverSong.new : Song.new(original: true) }
    end


## Hashes

As an addition to single properties and collections representable also offers to represent hash attributes.

    module SongRepresenter
      include Representable::JSON

      property :title
      hash :ratings
    end

    Song.new(title: "Bliss", ratings: {"Rolling Stone" => 4.9, "FryZine" => 4.5}).
    extend(SongRepresenter).to_json

    #=> {"title":"Bliss","ratings":{"Rolling Stone":4.9,"FryZine":4.5}}


## Lonely Hashes

Need to represent a bare hash without any container? Use the `JSON::Hash` representer (or XML::Hash).

    require 'representable/json/hash'

    module FavoriteSongsRepresenter
      include Representable::JSON::Hash
    end

    {"Nick" => "Hyper Music", "El" => "Blown In The Wind"}.extend(FavoriteSongsRepresenter).to_json
    #=> {"Nick":"Hyper Music","El":"Blown In The Wind"}

Works both ways. The values are configurable and might be self-representing objects in turn. Tell the `Hash` by using `#values`.

    module FavoriteSongsRepresenter
      include Representable::JSON::Hash

      values extend: SongRepresenter, class: Song
    end

    {"Nick" => Song.new(title: "Hyper Music")}.extend(FavoriteSongsRepresenter).to_json

 In XML, if you want to store hash attributes in tag attributes instead of dedicated nodes, use `XML::AttributeHash`.

## Lonely Collections

Same goes with arrays.

    require 'representable/json/collection'

    module SongsRepresenter
      include Representable::JSON::Collection

      items extend: SongRepresenter, class: Song
    end

The `#items` method lets you configure the contained entity representing here.

    [Song.new(title: "Hyper Music"), Song.new(title: "Screenager")].extend(SongsRepresenter).to_json
    #=> [{"title":"Hyper Music"},{"title":"Screenager"}]

Note that this also works for XML.


## YAML Support

Representable also comes with a YAML representer.

    module SongRepresenter
      include Representable::YAML

      property :title
      property :track
      collection :composers, :style => :flow
    end

A nice feature is that `#collection` also accepts a `:style` option which helps having nicely formatted inline (or "flow") arrays in your YAML - if you want that!

    song.extend(SongRepresenter).to_yaml
    #=>
    ---
    title: Fallout
    composers: [Steward Copeland, Sting]


## More on XML

### Mapping tag attributes

You can also map properties to tag attributes in representable.

    module SongRepresenter
      include Representable::XML

      property :title, attribute: true
      property :track, attribute: true
    end

    Song.new(title: "American Idle").to_xml
    #=> <song title="American Idle" />

Naturally, this works for both ways.

### Wrapping collections

It is sometimes unavoidable to wrap tag lists in a container tag.

    module AlbumRepresenter
      include Representable::XML

      collection :songs, :as => :song, :wrap => :songs
    end

Note that `:wrap` defines the container tag name.

    Album.new.to_xml #=>
      <album>
        <songs>
          <song>Laundry Basket</song>
          <song>Two Kevins</song>
          <song>Wright and Rong</song>
        </songs>
      </album>


## Avoiding Modules

There's been a rough discussion whether or not to use `extend` in Ruby. If you want to save that particular step when representing objects, define the representers right in your classes.

    class Song < OpenStruct
      include Representable::JSON

      property :name
    end

I do not recommend this approach as it bloats your domain classes with representation logic that is barely needed elsewhere.


## More Options

Here's a quick overview about other available options for `#property` and its bro `#collection`.


### Overriding Read And Write

This can be handy if a property needs to be compiled from several fragments. The lambda has access to the entire object document (either hash or `Nokogiri` node) and user options.

    property :title, :writer => lambda { |doc, args| doc["title"] = title || original_title }

When using the `:writer` option it is up to you to add fragments to the `doc` - representable won't add anything for this property.

The same works for parsing using `:reader`.

    property :title, :reader => lambda { |doc, args| self.title = doc["title"] || doc["name"] }

### Read/Write Restrictions

Using the `:readable` and `:writeable` options access to properties can be restricted.

    property :title, :readable => false

This will leave out the `title` property in the rendered document. Vice-versa, `:writeable` will skip the property when parsing and does not assign it.


### Filtering

Representable also allows you to skip and include properties using the `:exclude` and `:include` options passed directly to the respective method.

    song.to_json(:include => :title)
    #=> {"title":"Roxanne"}


### Conditions

You can also define conditions on properties using `:if`, making them being considered only when the block returns a true value.

    module SongRepresenter
      include Representable::JSON

      property :title
      property :track, if: lambda { track > 0 }
    end

When rendering or parsing, the `track` property is considered only if track is valid. Note that the block is executed in instance context, giving you access to instance methods.

As always, the block retrieves your options. Given this render call

    song.to_json(minimum_track: 2)

your `:if` may process the options.

    property :track, if: lambda { |opts| track > opts[:minimum_track] }


### False and Nil Values

Since representable-1.2 `false` values _are_ considered when parsing and rendering. That particularly means properties that used to be unset (i.e. `nil`) after parsing might be `false` now. Vice versa, `false` properties that weren't included in the rendered document will be visible now.

If you want `nil` values to be included when rendering, use the `:render_nil` option.

    property :track, render_nil: true

## Coercion

If you fancy coercion when parsing a document you can use the Coercion module which uses [virtus](https://github.com/solnic/virtus) for type conversion.

Include virtus in your Gemfile, first. Be sure to include virtus 0.5.0 or greater.

    gem 'virtus', ">= 0.5.0"

Use the `:type` option to specify the conversion target. Note that `:default` still works.

    module SongRepresenter
      include Representable::JSON
      include Representable::Coercion

      property :title
      property :recorded_at, :type => DateTime, :default => "May 12th, 2012"
    end


## Undocumented Features

(Please don't read this section!)

If you need a special binding for a property you're free to create it using the `:binding` option.

    property :title, :binding => lambda { |*args| JSON::TitleBinding.new(*args) }
